# About
Three short programs to practice parallel programming in C using the MPI standard.

* `vector_sum.c` parallel implementation of sum of two vectors
* `norm_calc.c` parallel implementation of calculating Euclidean norm of a vector
* `histogram.c` parallel implementation of calculating histogram of vector of random numbers from 0 to 100 with numbers being read from file `in.txt` generated by `histogram_IO.c` (problem requirement)

# Running the programs
Programs were compiled and ran supercomputer with Intel Haswell Cray XC40 architecture and cray-mpich 7.7.10 module. Steps to run the programs:
```
cc -o <compilation file> <filename.c>
srun -A <grant name> -n <number off processes> ./<compilation_file>
```
